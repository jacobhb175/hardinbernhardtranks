# HBRanks
HBRanks is a new way of ranking History Bowl and Quiz Bowl teams using a modified version of the glicko-2 Elo formula that takes into account strength of field, margin of victory, and difficulty of set. Northeast Regional Championships version now hosted by the Long Island Quiz Bowl Alliance at https://liquizbowl.wordpress.com/team-rankings/.
