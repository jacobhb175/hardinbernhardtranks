{"name":"HardinBernhardtRanks","tagline":"National History Bowl Rankings","body":"# Hardin-Bernhardt Ranks - Version 1.0.0\r\nHardin-Bernhardt Ranks is a new way of ranking NHBB teams using a modified version of the Go Elo formula that takes into account strength of field and margin of victory.\r\n\r\n## The Formulas\r\n### Expected Score Formula\r\nexpected score of A = 1 / ((e^((rank of B - rank of A) / rank of A)) + 1)\r\n\r\n### New Rank Formula\r\nnew rank of A = rank of A + q * K * ((score of A / ((score of A + score of B) * average T-value)) - expected score of A)\r\n\r\n## The Variables\r\n### q-Value\r\nThe q-value is used to represent strength of field at a tournament and intended to help improve elo as a measure of skill unaffected by the field a team is up against, and thus more useful and accurate as a comparison between teams from different regions. It is calculated as a ratio of average total points scored per game at a given tournament : average total points scored per game on a given set, and is calculated independently the for MS, JV, and Varsity fields.\r\n### T-Value\r\nThe T-value is used to account for the inherent issues in equating the percent chance of a given winning to the percent of total points that team will score. It is calculated as a ratio of the percent of total points scored by a given team : the percent chance given to that team to win. The g-value is used to account for the disparity in game numbers between tournaments, and is set equal to 10/games played.\r\n\r\n## List of Tournaments\r\nTournament|Date|Set Played|Status|Varsity q-Value|JV q-Value\r\n---|---|---|---|---|---\r\nSouthern California|3/1/2020|C|Complete|1.188|1.147\r\nArkansas|2/29/2020|C|Complete|0.959|0.743\r\nNew Hampshire|2/29/2020|C|Complete|1.066|0.818\r\nNorthern Pennsylvania|2/1/2020|C|Complete|0.841|-\r\nUpper Hudson|2/1/2020|C|Complete|0.982|0.990\r\nEastern Iowa|1/28/2020|C|Complete|1.130|0.917\r\nNevada|1/26/2020|C|Complete|1.225|1.020\r\nMississippi Winter|1/25/2020|C|Complete|0.775|0.892\r\nWestern Pennsylvania|1/25/2020|C|Complete|0.996|1.062\r\nSouthwestern Illinois|1/20/2020|C|Complete|1.038|1.001\r\nFlorida Panhandle|1/18/2020|C|Complete|0.962|0.360\r\nDeleware|1/11/2020|C|Complete|0.896|0.941\r\nLower Hudson|1/11/2020|C|Complete|1.085|1.182\r\nBergen County|1/5/2020|C|Complete|1.169|1.180\r\nEastern Kentucky|12/14/2019|C|Complete|1.006|-\r\nLouisiana Fall|12/14/2019|C|Complete|0.874|-\r\nNorthwest Illinois|12/14/2019|C|Complete|0.974|0.852\r\nSouthern New Jersey|12/14/2019|C|Complete|1.019|1.056\r\nWashington DC|12/7/2019|C|Complete|1.267|1.261\r\nBoston Fall|11/23/2019|C|Complete|1.065|1.118\r\nSouthern Washington|11/23/2019|C|Complete|0.997|-\r\nWestern Washington|11/23/2019|C|Complete|0.929|0.929\r\nCentral Florida Fall|11/16/2019|C|Complete|1.007|0.767\r\nEastern Georgia Fall|11/16/2019|C|Complete|1.083|1.000\r\nGreater Knoxville Fall|11/16/2019|C|Complete|0.846|-\r\nOahu|11/16/2019|C|Complete|1.068|-\r\nSouth Florida Fall|11/16/2019|C|Complete|0.880|0.959\r\nBuffalo|11/9/2019|C|Complete|0.960|0.727\r\nGreater Dayton|11/9/2019|C|Complete|1.212|0.521\r\nNorthern Illinois|11/9/2019|C|Complete|1.228|1.235\r\nNorthern New Jersey|11/9/2019|C|Complete|1.092|1.154\r\nWest Viginia Fall|11/9/2019|C|Complete|0.860|0.828\r\nMontana|11/5/2019|C|Complete|0.779|0.608\r\nCentral Georgia Fall|11/2/2019|C|Complete|0.898|0.723\r\nEastern Washington|11/2/2019|C|Complete|0.848|0.718\r\nNorthern California Fall|10/27/2019|C|Complete|1.222|1.213\r\n\r\n## The Rankings\r\n\r\n### Varsity Rankings\r\nRanking|Team|State|Points\r\n---|---|---|---\r\n1.|Millburn A|New Jersey|2105.886\r\n2.|Arcadia A|California|2082.677\r\n3.|Russellville A|Arkansas|2037.378\r\n4.|Stevenson C|Illinois|1925.355\r\n5.|Team Pi-oneers A|California|1885.982\r\n6.|Cambridge A|Georgia|1876.142\r\n7.|Team Coldhug A|Connecticut|1867.569\r\n8.|Great Valley A|Pennsylvania|1861.875\r\n9.|Trinity Prep A|Florida|1848.294\r\n10.|Canyon Crest Academy A|California|1845.995\r\n\r\n### Junior Varsity Rankings\r\nRanking|Team|State|Points\r\n---|---|---|---\r\n1.|Hunter College High B|New York|2074.658\r\n2.|Churchill A|New Jersey|2042.498\r\n3.|Methacton C|Pennsylvania|1900.241\r\n4.|Montgomery Blair B|Maryland|1893.419\r\n5.|St. Margaret's A|California|1885.588\r\n6.|Ridgewood C|New Jersey|1877.172\r\n7.|Ransom Everglades C|Florida|1876.610\r\n8.|Sagittarius|California|1831.614\r\n9.|Mission San Jose|California|1830.778\r\n10.|Phillips Exeter B|New Hampshire|1799.496","note":"Don't delete this file!
